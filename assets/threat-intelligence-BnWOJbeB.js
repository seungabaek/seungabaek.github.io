Building a secure, decentralized future for collaborative cybersecurity defense!

---

## Introduction

Iris is a global peer-to-peer network for sharing threat intelligence that addresses critical limitations in current centralized systems. As a team of five Georgia Tech students, we forked and enhanced the original Iris framework developed by Bc. Martin Řepa, implementing novel partial file transfer capabilities to improve bandwidth efficiency and system performance.

**Team Members:** Sabina Sokol, Keerthana Thotakura, Maria Jothish, Tran Ha, and Seung-a Baek

## The Problem: Why Current Systems Fail

Traditional threat intelligence sharing faces significant barriers that prevent effective collaboration:

### Real-World Scenario
Consider BankSecure, a financial institution that detects a sophisticated phishing campaign. Despite wanting to share this intelligence with other banks, several concerns prevent them from doing so:

- **Reputation Risk**: Public disclosure of being targeted could damage customer trust
- **Competitive Concerns**: Revealing security weaknesses could be exploited by competitors
- **Privacy & Legal Risks**: Threat intelligence contains sensitive customer metadata and internal logs
- **Centralized Trust Issues**: Traditional platforms are controlled by single entities that may misuse data

These concerns create a dangerous hesitation that delays critical information sharing, leaving other institutions vulnerable to similar attacks.

---

## Our Solution: Enhanced Iris Framework

Iris provides a completely decentralized P2P network that enables secure threat intelligence sharing through:

### Core Capabilities
- **Decentralized File Sharing**: Pure P2P network with no central authority
- **Alert Broadcasting**: Real-time notifications about detected attacks
- **Peer Consultation**: Ask network peers for opinions on potential threats
- **Cryptographic Organizations**: Trusted groups of peers within the network

### Novel Contribution: Partial File Transfer
Our key innovation addresses bandwidth efficiency through intelligent chunking:

1. **Metadata Request**: Peers learn file details including chunk hashes for verification
2. **Missing Chunk Detection**: Compare existing chunks via hashing
3. **Selective Downloading**: Request only missing chunks to save bandwidth
4. **Verified Reassembly**: Reconstruct complete files with integrity verification

---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Go 1.17**: High-performance backend implementation
- **LibP2P**: Modular peer-to-peer networking framework
- **Redis**: Message queuing and caching layer
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment and testing

### Network Design
Built on distributed hash tables (DHTs) with cryptographic verification:

- **Decentralized Discovery**: Peers find each other without central coordinators
- **Secure Communication**: End-to-end encryption for all data transfers
- **Trust Management**: Cryptographically-verified organizations for access control
- **Fault Tolerance**: No single points of failure in the network topology

### Chunking Algorithm Implementation
Our partial transfer system optimizes bandwidth usage:

\`\`\`
File Division → Chunk Identification → Missing Detection → Selective Transfer → Verification
\`\`\`

Each chunk includes SHA-256 hashes for integrity verification, ensuring secure and efficient partial downloads even in adversarial network conditions.

## Addressing Centralized System Limitations

### Traditional P2P Challenges
Early systems like Gnutella suffered from:
- Link congestion and bandwidth waste
- Single points of failure
- High administrative overhead
- Tampering risks due to centralized logging

### Our Improvements
- **Distributed Data Collection**: Multiple nodes reduce congestion
- **Cross-Peer Validation**: Anomaly detection through redundancy
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Partial transfers reduce network load
- **Cryptographic Trust**: Verified organizations ensure data integrity

---

## Development Environment & Tools

### OrgSig Management Tool
We developed a specialized tool for managing organizational trust:

\`\`\`bash
./orgsig --help
# Generate organizations or sign peer IDs
# Manage cryptographic verification of trusted groups
\`\`\`

### Multi-Peer Testing
Docker-compose setup enables comprehensive testing:
- 4 containerized peers in separate environments
- Shared Redis instance for message coordination
- Realistic network conditions simulation

---

## System Demonstration

### Partial File Transfer Example
\`\`\`bash
# Peer 1 shares file with only chunks 0,1,3 available
PUBLISH gp2p_tl2nl2 '{
  "type":"tl2nl_file_share",
  "data":{
    "total_size":420,
    "chunk_size":100,
    "chunk_count":5,
    "available_chunks":[0,1,3]
  }
}'

# Peer 2 requests specific chunks
PUBLISH gp2p_tl2nl1 '{
  "type":"tl2nl_file_share_download",
  "data":{
    "file_id":"QmS4FkBx1uBDHDLASvDocmfo5FXrXgNv4F8WRDkiNTUFe7",
    "chunks":[0,1,3]
  }
}'
\`\`\`

This demonstrates bandwidth savings by transferring only required chunks rather than complete files.

## Lessons Learned

This project provided invaluable experience in distributed systems engineering and cybersecurity. Working with Go's concurrency primitives taught us how to build highly performant networked applications at scale. The challenge of implementing secure, efficient partial file transfers required deep understanding of both cryptographic protocols and network optimization.

Most importantly, this project reinforced the critical importance of decentralization in cybersecurity infrastructure. By removing single points of failure and distributing trust across the network, we can build systems that are more resilient to both technical failures and adversarial attacks. The success of our chunking optimization demonstrates how targeted improvements can significantly enhance system efficiency while maintaining security guarantees.
