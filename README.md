# My First Portfolio

This is my first attempt at a personal portfolio! [Check it out!](https://seungabaek.github.io/)

I'll be constantly working on updating it and improving it as I learn more and grow in my career! I built this with React working in Vite initially following along a [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/YQCDUJ6hhNY?si=LRcKcydc1Ic-Qs-w). I've personalized it a lot along the way!

Be back soon!
