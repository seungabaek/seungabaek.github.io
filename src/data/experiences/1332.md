# My Journey as a CS 1332 Teaching Assistant

Being a part of CS 1332 (Data Structures & Algorithms) at Georgia Tech has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my college career. I started as a TA the summer after my second year. Funny enough, I had just switched my major to Computer Science that same year. In other words, CS 1332 was my FIRST computer science course as an "official" CS student, and for someone with absolutely no background in anything computer related, it was hard (I was originally an Earth and Atmospheric Sciences student who just wanted a more unique skillset). It took a lot of effort, and at the end, I realized it was a lot of fun. So I applied to be a TA. 

Even up till my fourth semester, every semester, I still had to "relearn" some concepts like KMP pattern matching and differentiating between left-right and right-left AVL rotations, but the role has allowed me to bridge the gap between learning and teaching. It's a role I applied to with absolutely no hopes of getting, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

## The Challenge of Scale

CS 1332 is one of the largest computer science courses at Georgia Tech, with enrollment often exceeding 1000 students per semester. The scale presents unique challenges: 

- **Diverse Learning Styles**: Students come from various backgrounds with different levels of programming experience
- **Complex Topics**: Data structures and algorithms can be abstract and challenging for many students
- **Time Management**: Balancing individual attention with the needs of a large class

## My Responsibilities

### Weekly Recitations
Every week, I lead recitation sessions, focusing on:
- **Lecture Review**: Breaking down algorithms conceptually and relating them to real-world applications
- **Interactive Problem Solving**: Guiding implementations step-by-step
- **Live Coding Sessions**: Demonstrating best coding practices & the occasional Leet-ing (LeetCode)
- **Q&A Sessions**: Addressing specific student questions and common misconceptions
- **Kahoot**: Obviously!

### Office Hours
I hold 3-hour weekly office hours where I:
- **One-on-One Tutoring**: Help students debug their code and understand algorithmic concepts
- **Exam Preparation**: Guide students through practice problems and exam strategies

### Homework and Exam Grading
- **Efficiency Deductions**: Individually reviewing auto-graded homeworks for uncaught inefficiencies
- **Exam Grading**: All exams are handwritten, so coding questions are all graded manually

## Impact and Growth

This role has taught me invaluable skills in:
- **Communication**: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"
- **Leadership**: Managing classroom dynamics and fostering inclusive learning environments
- **Problem-Solving**: Helping students approach debugging and algorithmic challenges systematically


## Technical Expertise Developed

Through this teaching experience, I've deepened my understanding of:
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Trees, graphs, hash tables, and their real-world applications
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Big-O notation, time and space complexity analysis
- **Java Programming**: Advanced object-oriented programming concepts and best practices


## My Final Semester and My Last Recitation

The end of an era!

This past Spring semester was my final semester as a CS 1332 TA. In the back you can see Lindsay teaching Kruskals as Jessica and I invade her Photo Booth. Our last recitation of the Spring semester was a final exam review (no one showed up), so we went across the street to Paper and Clay and just hung out :)). 

I've had the privilege of working alongside an incredible team of fellow teaching assistants. Each semester brings new faces and new connections, and I'm gonna miss this.

### Looking Forward

While my time as a CS 1332 TA is coming to an end, the experience has fundamentally shaped how I approach problem-solving, communication, and leadership. The skills I've developed here - breaking down complex problems, adapting explanations to different learning styles, and maintaining patience under pressure - are invaluable assets I'll carry into my future career.

This role continues to shape my approach to software development and has reinforced my passion for computer science education. Most importantly, it's shown me the profound impact that dedicated educators can have on students' academic journeys.
