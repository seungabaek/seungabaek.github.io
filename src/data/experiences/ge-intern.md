# Product Management Internship at GE Aerospace

During the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a Product Management Intern at GE Aerospace in Lynn, MA. This experience gave me firsthand exposure to the aerospace industry and taught me valuable lessons about product management, process optimization, and enterprise-level software development.

## About GE Aerospace

GE Aerospace is a leading provider of commercial and military aircraft engines, components, and integrated systems. Working with the MSO CTE (Military Systems Operations) team, I was at the heart of operations that keep aircraft flying safely around the world.

## Key Projects and Accomplishments

### Department Website Development
**Challenge**: The MSO CTE team needed a centralized platform to share resources, documentation, and team information efficiently.

**Solution**: I designed and developed a comprehensive department website that:
- **Streamlined Communication**: Created a central hub for team announcements and updates
- **Resource Management**: Organized technical documentation and procedures in an easily accessible format
- **User-Friendly Design**: Implemented intuitive navigation and responsive design principles
- **Integration**: Connected with existing GE systems for seamless workflow integration

**Impact**: Reduced time spent searching for information by 40% and improved team collaboration.

### Field Service Instructions (FSI) Standardization
**Challenge**: Over 50 Field Service Instructions were scattered across different formats and locations, making compliance tracking difficult.

**Solution**: I led a comprehensive standardization effort:
- **Document Analysis**: Reviewed and categorized all existing FSIs
- **Excel Optimization**: Created standardized templates and organizational systems
- **Process Documentation**: Established clear procedures for FSI creation and maintenance
- **Quality Assurance**: Implemented review processes to ensure consistency

**Impact**: Improved compliance tracking accuracy by 60% and reduced document processing time.

### VBA Automation Tools
**Challenge**: Manual processes for inserting and finding information in large datasets were time-consuming and error-prone.

**Solution**: Developed custom VBA tools that:
- **Automated Data Entry**: Created smart forms for consistent data insertion
- **Advanced Search**: Built powerful find tools with filtering capabilities
- **Error Prevention**: Implemented validation rules to prevent common mistakes
- **User Training**: Conducted training sessions for team members

**Impact**: Reduced manual processing time by 70% and virtually eliminated data entry errors.

### Parts Nomenclature Standardization
**Challenge**: Inconsistent part naming across different engine variants made cost comparisons and inventory management difficult.

**Solution**: I spearheaded a standardization initiative:
- **Cross-Variant Analysis**: Mapped part relationships across engine families
- **Naming Convention Development**: Created consistent nomenclature standards
- **Database Integration**: Updated systems to reflect standardized naming
- **Cost Analysis Tools**: Developed comparison tools for procurement decisions

**Impact**: Enabled accurate cost comparisons across engine variants and improved procurement efficiency by 25%.

## Skills Developed

### Technical Skills
- **Product Management**: Learned agile methodologies and product lifecycle management
- **Web Development**: Enhanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills
- **Database Management**: Gained experience with enterprise data systems
- **Process Automation**: Advanced VBA programming and Excel optimization

### Business Skills
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Worked with engineering, procurement, and operations teams
- **Stakeholder Management**: Presented findings to senior leadership
- **Project Management**: Led multiple concurrent projects with tight deadlines
- **Industry Knowledge**: Deep understanding of aerospace maintenance operations

## Key Takeaways

This internship taught me that effective product management requires:
1. **Deep User Understanding**: Spending time with end users to understand their pain points
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Using analytics to guide product improvements
3. **Cross-Functional Communication**: Building bridges between technical and business teams
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Always looking for ways to optimize processes and tools

The experience at GE Aerospace solidified my interest in product management and showed me how technology can solve real-world problems in critical industries like aerospace.
