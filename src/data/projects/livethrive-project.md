My first completely full-stack application from scratch for a client!

----

### Introduction

For my junior capstone project, I worked with a team of 4 other CS students to create a full-stack mobile 
application compatible on both iOS and Android platforms for a local nonprofit. As background, Live Thrive's CHaRM 
(Center for Hard to Recycle Materials) facilities encourage a sustainable Atlanta community by providing 
a place for local residents and businesses to drop off "hard-to-recycle" materials. This can range from appliances
to chemicals to compost and etc. 

To drop off materials, an appointment is required. They used SimplyBook as a 3rd-party booking
system to manage all appointments. This meant limited control and a lot of complaints.

The project spanned two semesters:
1. Planning
2. Execution

I worked with the same team and same client for both semesters, mimicking a real world client-teamwork environment.
We had a team charter, had a client charter, did user research, did peer evaluations, used Figma for prototyping, 
used Maze for usability testing, conducted strict sprints under a Scrum framework, and demoed after each Sprint. 
As long as the project duration was, we were able to take it step-by-step and learn how to go from ideation to launch.
